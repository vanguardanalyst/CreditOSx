export const sampleTranscript = `Operator: Good morning and welcome to Asteria Networks Q2 2025 earnings call.

CEO: Q2 revenue was $1.28 billion, down 6% year-over-year due to weaker enterprise routing demand. Adjusted EBITDA was $238 million, down 15% year-over-year, and adjusted EBITDA margin declined 210 basis points to 18.6%. Free cash flow was $74 million, compared with $132 million in the prior-year period due to working capital outflows.

CFO: We ended the quarter with $690 million of cash and undrawn revolver capacity of $410 million. Total gross debt is $3.7 billion and net leverage is now 5.6x LTM EBITDA versus 4.9x last quarter.

CFO: Upcoming maturities include $450 million in 2026 secured notes, $900 million in 2027 unsecured notes, and $1.1 billion term loan due in 2028.

CEO: We repurchased $120 million of equity this quarter while continuing tuck-in M&A activity. We remain in compliance with maintenance covenants with 22% EBITDA cushion to springing tests.

CFO: We are evaluating potential liability management options, including an exchange offer, to smooth the 2027 and 2028 maturity profile.

Operator: This concludes the call.`;
